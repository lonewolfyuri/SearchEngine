unshackled by occupy himself to all
elated by his rank him
supercilious contrary he all attention to By
inoffensive friendly his presentation at
made him courteous

a very kind woman too clever to be a
neighbour to children
a intelligent young woman about twenty seven


Miss Lucases Miss should meet to
a absolutely necessary assembly
to to to

You began evening well Charlotte
self command to Miss You

but he seemed to like his

you I because he danced To be

I something about but I know what something
about Robinson

Perhaps you what I overheard him Robinson
I mention to you Robinson him he liked our Meryton
assemblies whether he a great
pretty which he thought prettiest his
immediately to last question Miss
beyond a doubt be two point

Upon Well very does

close to hour once his lips

Are you ma a mistake
I Darcy to

Aye because she him at last he liked Netherfield he
could help but she he seemed at
to

Miss he

I believe a he very
agreeable he have to Long But I guess

His Miss does offend

his he

observed who piqued herself upon solidity
reflections a very common failing I believe By all I have
I convinced very common
particularly prone to are very few us
who cherish a self complacency score some
quality other imaginary are
words are often used synonymously A person
be relates more to our opinion
ourselves to what have others us

I rich Darcy cried a young who
his sisters I should I I keep a pack
foxhounds a bottle a day

soon Netherfield
soon returned due Miss pleasing manners grew
goodwill Miss
found to be sisters to
a expressed towards
two By this attention
pleasure but superciliousness treatment
excepting sister could like
kindness to a value arising
all probability from influence admiration
evident he admire
to equally evident to
which she begun to him from a
to be very love but she pleasure
to be by general since
united great a composure a
which guard from
She mentioned this to Miss

perhaps be pleasant replied Charlotte to be able to impose
a case but sometimes a to be
very a woman conceals skill
from she lose fixing him
will be but poor consolation to believe equally
dark almost
attachment to to itself all
freely a slight but are
very few us who have heart to be really love
encouragement nine out ten a more
she feels likes sister but he
more like she does help him

But she does help him will allow I
him he be a simpleton to
too

Eliza he does know disposition you

But a woman partial to a does endeavour to
he find out

Perhaps he he But

plan a one replied nothing
question but well married I determined
to a rich I I should But
are she acting by design

reasonableness She known him a She danced

since him company This
to his

you represent she him she might
have whether he a but you
evenings have also spent
evenings a great

evenings have enabled to
both like Vingt un Commerce but respect to other

Well Charlotte I success all heart

chance happiness she to be studying his a
Happiness marriage a chance

have share to know
defects person whom you are to pass


You Charlotte but You know
you this

observing attentions to sister
far from suspecting she herself some
his Darcy at scarcely
to be pretty he looked at admiration at
next he looked at to criticise But
he made clear to himself his friends she
a feature face he began to find rendered
uncommonly intelligent by beautiful dark To
this some others equally mortifying he
detected a eye more one failure perfect symmetry
he to to be light
pleasing his asserting manners
fashionable he by
this she perfectly unaware to he who made
himself agreeable nowhere who thought
to

He began to to know more a step towards conversing
himself to conversation others His doing
at Sir William a large party


What does Darcy she to Charlotte by listening to
conversation Colonel Forster

a question which Darcy

But he does more I shall let him know I see
what he about He a very satirical eye I by
I shall soon afraid him

his approaching soon seeming to have
intention Miss defied to mention
a to him which immediately provoking to she
to him

you Darcy I expressed uncommonly
well I teasing Colonel Forster to us a at
Meryton

great but a which makes a
energetic

You are us

will be soon to be teased Miss I
to Eliza you know what follows

You are a very strange creature by a
to play sing taken
a musical you have but I
really rather sit who be
very performers Miss persevering
she added Very well be gravely glancing
at Darcy a fine which
course familiar Keep to cool porridge I
shall keep to swell song

performance pleasing by capital a song
two she could to
she sing she at by
sister who having consequence plain one
family hard knowledge
impatient display

neither genius
application likewise a pedantic conceited
which have injured a higher degree excellence she
reached to
more pleasure playing well at
a long concerto glad to purchase praise by
Scotch Irish airs at sisters who
some Lucases two officers joined
dancing at one

Darcy stood indignation at a mode
passing evening to exclusion all conversation too
engrossed by his to Sir William
his neighbour Sir William thus began

What a charming amusement young this Darcy
nothing like dancing all I one
refinements polished society

sir also vogue
less polished societies savage

Sir William smiled performs he
continued a seeing I doubt
you are adept science Darcy

You at Meryton I believe sir

inconsiderable pleasure from
you often at

sir

you be a proper compliment to

a compliment which I to I avoid

You have a house town I conclude

Darcy bowed

I once some thought fixing town I fond
superior society but I feel


He hopes but his
to at instant moving towards he
action doing a very gallant out to


Miss Eliza why are you dancing Darcy you allow
to present this young to you a very partner You
refuse to I you
he have to Darcy who
extremely surprised to receive she
back some to Sir William

sir I have least intention dancing I entreat you
to I moved this to beg a partner

Darcy grave propriety requested to be
but determined Sir William at
all shake purpose by his at persuasion

You excel Miss Eliza cruel to deny
happiness seeing you this dislikes
amusement general he have I to us
one hour

Darcy all smiling

He but Miss Eliza
at his complaisance who to a
partner

looked archly resistance
injured he some
complacency thus accosted by Miss

I guess reverie

I should imagine

You are insupportable be to pass evenings
this society I opinion
I more annoyed insipidity noise
nothingness self importance all What
I to strictures

I assure you more
agreeably engaged I have meditating very great pleasure
which a pair fine face a pretty woman

Miss immediately fixed his face desired he
what inspiring reflections
Darcy replied great intrepidity

Miss

very rapid jumps from admiration to love from love

minutes at gate to his inquiries all

formality to his abode punctually repeated all his wife


prepared to see him his glory she could help
fancying its

to feel what she lost him But
seemed neat comfortable she able to
gratify him by repentance rather looked at
she could have cheerful a
Collins which his wife might be
ashamed which unseldom she
eye Charlotte Once she could discern a faint blush but
general Charlotte long to
admire from sideboard to
fender to account all
happened Collins invited to a stroll
garden which large well out to cultivation
which he himself To this garden one his most
pleasures command
which Charlotte healthfulness exercise
owned she encouraged
through walk cross walk scarcely allowing
to praises he view out
a minuteness which behind He could number
fields could trees
most distant clump But all which his garden which
could boast to be compared
Rosings by trees
park front his house a
modern building well

From his garden Collins have led his two meadows
but having shoes to remains a white
frost back while Sir William accompanied him Charlotte
sister house extremely well pleased
probably to have
help rather small but well built
fitted up arranged a neatness consistency which
Charlotte all Collins could be
forgotten really great comfort throughout by
Charlotte evident supposed he be often
forgotten

She learnt Catherine
while at Collins joining
observed

Miss you will have seeing Catherine

About next day she getting ready

Collins Charlotte both standing at gate conversation
Sir William to high diversion
stationed doorway
him bowing Miss looked


At length nothing more to be
others returned house Collins two
he began to which
Charlotte by letting know whole party
to dine at Rosings next day



29


Collins consequence this invitation
power grandeur his patroness to his wondering
letting see civility towards himself his
wife exactly what he wished
doing should be soon instance
Catherine he to admire

I confess he I should have at all surprised by
ladyship us to tea evening at
Rosings I rather from knowledge affability
happen But who could have foreseen attention this Who
could have should receive invitation to dine
invitation including whole party immediately


I less surprised at what happened replied Sir William
from knowledge what manners great really are which
to acquire About court
instances breeding are uncommon

Scarcely whole day next but
to Rosings Collins carefully instructing what
to expect rooms servants
a might wholly overpower

separating he to

cousin about apparel
Catherine far from requiring elegance dress us which
becomes herself I advise you to put
whatever superior to rest
more Catherine will worse you
simply dressed She likes to have rank
preserved

While dressing he two to
to Catherine very
objected to be waiting accounts
ladyship Maria
who used to company she looked forward to
introduction at Rosings done
to his presentation at

weather fine a pleasant walk about a
park park its its prospects

courage She nothing
Catherine awful from extraordinary
mere stateliness money rank she thought
she could witness trepidation

From which Collins out a
rapturous fine finished ornaments
followed servants through ante chamber to
Catherine Jenkinson ladyship
great arose to receive Collins

be performed a proper
apologies which he have thought necessary

having at Sir William completely
awed by grandeur surrounding him he but courage

equal to scene could
composedly Catherine a large woman
which might once have
conciliating to

silence but whatever she authoritative a
self importance Wickham immediately to

Catherine to be exactly what he

examining deportment
she soon found some Darcy she
she could almost have joined Maria astonishment at
thin small neither face
likeness Miss pale sickly
plain insignificant she very
a to Jenkinson appearance
nothing who engaged listening
to what she placing a screen proper


a few minutes all sent to one windows to
admire view Collins attending to point out its beauties
Catherine kindly

exceedingly all servants
all articles plate which Collins he
likewise foretold he his at bottom table by
ladyship looked he could furnish
nothing greater He carved praised
alacrity dish commended by him by Sir
William who recovered to echo whatever his

But Catherine seemed by excessive admiration
most dish table
a novelty to party supply conversation
ready to but she
Charlotte Miss whom engaged
listening to Catherine a to all
Jenkinson chiefly employed watching
Miss pressing to try some other dish fearing
she indisposed Maria thought out question
nothing but admire

returned to drawing to
be done but to Catherine which she
delivering opinion
decisive a she used to
have judgement controverted She inquired Charlotte domestic
concerns familiarly minutely a great advice
to all ought to be
regulated small a family instructed to
cows poultry found nothing
beneath this great attention which could furnish
dictating to others intervals discourse
Collins she addressed a variety questions to Maria
but to connections she
least who she observed to Collins a very
pretty kind She at sisters
she whether older herself whether
to be married whether
educated what what
maiden all impertinence

observed
